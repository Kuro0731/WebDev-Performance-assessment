        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          Hi there! I'm a passionate and dedicated full-stack developer with a
          love for creating seamless, user-friendly applications. Over the
          years, I've honed my skills in both front-end and back-end
          development, working on a variety of projects that span from simple
          websites to complex systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          My journey began with an interest in problem-solving and technology,
          which led me to dive deep into the world of web development. I have
          worked with a range of technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
          Python, and Django, along with Vue.js for building dynamic,
          interactive user interfaces. I’m particularly drawn to the challenge
          of turning abstract ideas into concrete, functional products that
          people can interact with and enjoy.
        </p>

        <p>
          I pride myself on my ability to adapt to new technologies and
          frameworks, continuously learning and improving my skills to stay on
          top of industry trends. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code,
          and I am always looking for ways to optimize performance while keeping
          the user experience in mind. Collaboration is key to creating
          successful projects, and I thrive in team environments where we can
          share knowledge and ideas to achieve the best possible outcomes.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to my technical skills, I bring a wealth of experience
          from my background in customer service, healthcare, and project
          management. These roles have helped me develop a strong attention to
          detail, a problem-solving mindset, and an ability to communicate
          effectively with diverse teams and clients.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I’m not coding, I enjoy reading novels, exploring new
          technologies, and working on personal projects that push my
          creativity. My ultimate goal is to combine my technical expertise with
          my passion for user experience to build innovative solutions that make
          a positive impact.
